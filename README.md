# ***Hello Website***
my "hello world" exploration into web development

>Currently it serves as a fun testing ground for all things web related. Although it was intended to be a peronal website,

>Future plans include
> - Influencer/Alpha Male ranking website
> - resume on 7e6i.net
> - building out Genesee Vinyl 



## Current layout
> Pages I'd like to add appear in *italics*
